Upon logging in, PEMx monitoring widgets are shown prominently on the home page or on the project summary page. These widgets are available only for the deployed PostgreSQL clusters and are not available for the clusters in the provisioning process. They provide a high level key information on:
- Memory
- CPU
- Storage usage percentages
- Database size
- Transactions per second

To see more in-depth metrics specific to the PostgreSQL cluster click on any widget. It redirects to the **Monitoring and Logging** tab of the cluster page.

1. Go to **Clusters** in the left navigation of BigAnimal portal. 
2. Select any ready cluster. 
3. Select **Monitoring and Logging** tab on the cluster detail page.

The **Monitoring and Logging** tab displays the detailed PEMx monitoring metrics specific to that cluster:

- Single-stat charts &mdash; These charts highlights a single specific value based on the last value in the selected time interval. For example, if you choose ``last N``, it displays the current value and for the specific time interval, it displays the value at the end of the selected time interval. These charts display key metrics in text, gauges, or pie and donut form. It provides a concise snapshot of information such as: 
  - Memory (Gauge chart) &mdash; Displays the percentage of memory utilized by the node hosting the PostgreSQL cluster.
  - CPU (Gauge chart) &mdash; Displays the percentage of CPU utilized for the PostgreSQL cluster.
  - Storage (Gauge chart) &mdash; Displays the percentage of the storage volume utilized by the PostgreSQL cluster.
  - Storage (Donut chart) &mdash; Displays the units of the storage volume utilized for the PostgreSQL cluster.
  - Active connections (Text chart) &mdash; Displays the current number of connections between the client applications and the database.
  - Disk throughput (Text chart) &mdash; Displays the amount of data transferred to and from the disk per second.
  - Transactions per second (Text chart) &mdash; Displays the total number of transactions executing within a second for the PostgreSQL cluster.
  - Database size (Text chart) &mdash; Displays the amount of storage volume utilized by the database.
