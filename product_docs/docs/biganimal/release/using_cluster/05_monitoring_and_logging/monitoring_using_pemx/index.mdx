title: "Monitoring using PEMx"
---

PEMx is an integrated monitoring and alerting solution within BigAnimal. It is specially designed to monitor the performance of the Postgres clusters. PEMx actively monitors various metrics of the monitored Postgres clusters and triggers alert as the defined thresholds are exceeded. This solution smoothly integrates into the BigAnimal ecosystem, utilizing the vast amount of metric data that is gathered from Postgres clusters in the data-planes. BigAnimal consolidates and exposes these metrics in each data-plane using Prometheus.
